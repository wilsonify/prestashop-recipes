# Adding a Date/Time Picker to Product Pages

## Problem

For products that require delivery or booking information, such as appointments, rentals, or services with a specified date and time, it is often necessary to include a date/time picker on the product page. This allows customers to select a specific date and time for their service.

In PrestaShop, there is no default field available for capturing this information directly on the product page. The challenge is to incorporate a simple and user-friendly way for customers to specify the date and time they require, which is critical for businesses that rely on scheduling or specific delivery times.

### Why is this a Problem?

Without an easy way to capture the date and time from customers, businesses can face operational difficulties, including:

- **Miscommunication**: Without a clear way to choose a date and time, customers might not provide the necessary details or make incorrect assumptions about when the service will occur.
- **Manual Workarounds**: Admins may need to rely on notes or email communication to capture booking or delivery details, which increases the chance for errors and delays.
- **Poor Customer Experience**: A lack of clarity or ease of use on the product page could frustrate customers and lead to abandoned purchases or missed appointments.

By adding a date/time picker, we can enhance the customer experience, streamline business operations, and reduce errors related to delivery or service scheduling.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, we’ll integrate a date/time picker into the PrestaShop product page using a JQuery calendar. This calendar is already available in the PrestaShop back office (e.g., in the **Stats** section for setting date ranges), so we will repurpose it for our product page. This allows us to reuse existing functionality without needing to create a custom solution from scratch.

The solution can be broken down into three main steps:
1. **Add a Customization Field**: Create a field on the product page where customers can select a date and time.
2. **Include the Necessary Scripts and Styles**: Integrate the JQuery date picker functionality on the product page.
3. **Make the Date Picker Functional**: Add a script to activate the date picker and make it interactive for the customer.

### How it Works

The integration of a date/time picker can be done in a few steps. Below, we'll go over each part of the solution in detail:

### Step 1: Add a Customization Field

First, we need to create a new customization field on the product page where the customer will be able to select the date/time for their service.

1. In your PrestaShop back office, navigate to **Catalog** → **Products**.
2. Select the product for which you want to add the date/time field.
3. Click on the **Customization** tab in the product configuration screen.
4. Here, you can add a new custom field (e.g., "Service Date/Time") where customers can enter or select the required date and time.

This customization field will be visible to customers on the product page.

### Step 2: Include the Necessary Scripts and Styles

Next, we need to include the required CSS and JavaScript for the JQuery date picker to work on the product page.

1. Open the **product.tpl** file of your theme, which controls the layout of the product page.
2. Add the following code to the `<head>` section to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files:
3. You may also want to add some additional styling or customize the appearance of the date picker to fit your theme.

```html
<!-- Include JQuery UI CSS for the date picker -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css">

<!-- Include JQuery and JQuery UI JS for date picker functionality -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
```

Step 3: Make the Date Picker Functional

Now, we need to activate the date picker on the product page by adding a script that binds the date picker functionality to the field we created in Step 1.

    Still in the product.tpl file, locate the custom field you added for date/time selection.
    Below the field, add a script like the following to activate the JQuery date picker:

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    // Initialize the date picker on the custom field
    $("#customization_field_id").datepicker({
      dateFormat: 'yy-mm-dd', // Define the date format (adjust if necessary)
      minDate: 0,             // Prevent selecting past dates
      showTime: true,         // Allow time selection (if applicable)
      timeFormat: 'HH:mm',    // Format time (adjust as needed)
      showButtonPanel: true   // Show button panel for quick date selection
    });
  });
</script>

    Replace #customization_field_id with the actual ID or class of the field you added in Step 1.

This script enables the date picker functionality for the field, allowing customers to choose a date and time when they select the product.
Step 4: Testing the Date Picker

Once the date picker is integrated, thoroughly test it:

    Check Responsiveness: Ensure the date picker works across devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
    Test Date/Time Selection: Make sure customers can select a date and time, and that the information is correctly saved with the order.

Conclusion

By following these steps, you can add a functional date/time picker to your PrestaShop product pages, allowing customers to select their preferred delivery or booking date and time. This improves the customer experience and simplifies scheduling, leading to fewer errors and better communication.

This solution leverages PrestaShop's existing date picker functionality to streamline the process and avoid reinventing the wheel. As a result, it’s both efficient and effective.
