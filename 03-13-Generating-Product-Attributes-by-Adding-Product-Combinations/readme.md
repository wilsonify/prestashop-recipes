# Defining Product Attributes in PrestaShop

## Problem

You need to define a set of **attributes** for your products to allow variations such as size, color, or material.

## Solution

In PrestaShop, product attributes are managed through **combinations**. You can define attributes via the **Back Office**:

1. Navigate to **Catalog → Products**.
2. Select the product you want to edit.
3. Click on the **Combinations** tab in the left panel.
4. Use the **Product Combination Generator** to create different variations of the product automatically.

## How It Works

Attributes work by combining different values to generate product variations. For example, consider:

- **Attribute A** with values: `A1`, `A2`, `A3`
- **Attribute B** with values: `B1`, `B2`

The possible combinations would be:

- `A1-B1`
- `A1-B2`
- `A2-B1`
- `A2-B2`
- `A3-B1`
- `A3-B2`

Manually creating these combinations can be time-consuming, especially when handling multiple attributes. To simplify the process, PrestaShop provides the **Product Combination Generator**, which automates the creation of all possible combinations based on selected attributes.

### Using the Product Combination Generator

1. Go to **Catalog → Products** in the Back Office.
2. Select a product and navigate to the **Combinations** tab.
3. Click **Generate Combinations**.
4. Choose the attributes you want to combine.
5. Click **Generate** to create all possible variations.
6. Adjust stock, pricing, or images for each combination as needed.

## Conclusion

By leveraging PrestaShop’s **Product Combination Generator**, you can efficiently create multiple variations of a product without manual entry. This tool helps streamline product management and enhances the shopping experience by offering flexible options to customers.
