# Creating Custom Hooks for Modules in PrestaShop

## Problem Statement
You want to create your own custom hook so that modules can be attached to it. This is useful if you need to place content or functionality in a specific part of your PrestaShop store that is not already covered by the default hooks.

## Solution Overview
In PrestaShop, hooks are mechanisms that allow modules to insert content or perform actions in predefined locations on your site. Hooks can be categorized into two main types:
- **Visual Hooks**: These allow modules to display content at specific locations on the page (e.g., the header, footer, product pages).
- **Action Hooks**: These execute specific actions at certain points in the application lifecycle (e.g., before an order is placed, after a customer logs in).

To create your own hook, you need to declare it in both your module and the relevant template files.

## How It Works

### 1. Create a Custom Hook in Your Module

To create a custom hook, you will need to modify the module's PHP file. In the module’s `install()` function, you’ll use the `registerHook()` method to register your new hook.

Here’s an example of how to create a custom hook in a module:

```php
public function install()
{
    return parent::install() && $this->registerHook('displayCustomHook');
}
