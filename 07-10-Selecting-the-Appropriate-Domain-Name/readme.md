# Problem: Improving Your SEO with a Relevant Domain Name

## Overview

One important yet often overlooked factor for improving your SEO is choosing the right **domain name**. Google and other search engines consider your domain name as one of the key ranking factors. A well-chosen domain can boost your site's search engine rankings and help visitors understand what your business is about at a glance.

## Why This Is a Problem

The domain name is one of the first things both search engines and potential customers notice. Having relevant **keywords** in your domain can improve your visibility and rank for those terms. This is important for businesses looking to gain traffic from organic search results.

For example, if you are in the **car business**, having a domain name with car-related keywords will signal to both search engines and visitors that your site is about cars. A domain like `www.havanaclassiccartour.com` immediately tells both users and search engines what your business focuses on, which can help improve rankings for search queries related to classic cars or tours.

## Solution

To improve your SEO, select a domain name that includes relevant keywords for your business. This will give you a better chance of ranking higher in search results for those keywords.

### How to Change Your Domain Name in PrestaShop

If you want to change your domain name in PrestaShop (especially during a migration), here’s how you can do it:

1. **Go to Back Office**:
   - Log into your PrestaShop admin dashboard.

2. **Navigate to SEO & URLs Settings**:

#### Important Note:

### How It Works

Google uses domain names as part of its ranking algorithm. A relevant, keyword-rich domain can give your site an advantage by helping it show up for search terms related to your business. For instance:
- If you’re in the **car sales** business, your domain could include words like "classic car," "car sales," or "tour."
- A relevant domain can also help improve click-through rates (CTR) when users see your site in search results.

Having a domain like `www.havanaclassiccartour.com`:
- Signals that your site is relevant to **classic car tours**.
- Improves your chance of ranking for search queries related to **classic cars**, **car tours**, or **car-related activities**.

### Conclusion

Choosing the right domain name is a strategic decision that can have a direct impact on your SEO. By including relevant keywords in your domain, you help search engines understand what your site is about and increase the chances of ranking well for those terms. Ensure your domain name is clear, concise, and representative of your business.

### Key Takeaways:
- A **relevant domain name** is crucial for SEO.
- Including important **keywords** in your domain can improve your site’s ranking.
- Change your domain name through the Back Office under **Preferences** > **SEO & URLs**.
