# Creating a Simple "Hello World" Module for PrestaShop

## Problem Statement
You want to create a PrestaShop module that, when installed, displays "Hello World" on the header of your site.

## Solution Overview
PrestaShop modules are stored in a **modules** folder located at the root of your PrestaShop installation. Each module is contained in its own folder, and within this folder, several files are required to define the module and its functionality.

For our "Hello World" module, we’ll need to create a few essential files, which include:
- A **main PHP file** to define the module's logic.
- An **icon file** (for use in the Back Office).
- An optional **configuration file** (which is typically auto-generated by PrestaShop).

### Essential Module Files:
Every PrestaShop module should have these three core files:
1. **config.xml**: The configuration file that stores caching information for the module (automatically created by PrestaShop when installing the module).
2. **logo.png** (for PrestaShop 1.5+) or **logo.gif**/**logo.jpg** (for versions up to PrestaShop 1.4): The icon that represents the module in the Back Office. Dimensions should be **16x16 pixels**.
3. **your_module_name.php**: The main PHP file, which must have the same name as the module’s folder. This file handles the primary functionality of the module.

PrestaShop automatically generates the **config.xml** during the installation of the module, so for our "Hello World" module, we’ll mainly focus on creating the **PHP file** and the **icon file**.

## Steps to Create the Module

### 1. Create the Module Folder:
First, navigate to the **modules** directory at the root of your PrestaShop installation. Create a folder for your new module. In this case, we’ll call it **helloworld**.
