# Problem: Generating the robots.txt File for Your PrestaShop Site

## Overview

The **robots.txt** file is an essential part of the **Robot Exclusion Protocol**. It serves as a request to web crawlers (or bots) to not index or follow certain pages or directories on your website. This is important for preventing the search engine from indexing pages that are either irrelevant, duplicate, or private, which could negatively affect your SEO or user experience.

In this guide, we will walk through the process of generating a **robots.txt** file in PrestaShop and explain why and when you might want to use it.

## Why This Is a Problem

Without a proper **robots.txt** file, search engines may end up indexing pages that you don’t want to appear in search results. For example, certain pages such as admin panels, duplicate content, or irrelevant files can clutter search results and harm your site’s SEO.

A **robots.txt** file gives you control over which areas of your site are indexed by search engines, allowing you to:
- **Protect private data**: Prevent sensitive directories or files from being indexed.
- **Optimize SEO**: Focus search engine crawlers on your most valuable pages.
- **Avoid duplicate content**: Block duplicate pages (e.g., session IDs, filters) from being indexed.
- **Save crawl budget**: Ensure search engines spend time indexing your most important pages.

## Solution

PrestaShop makes it easy to generate and manage the **robots.txt** file directly from the Back Office.

### Steps to Generate robots.txt in PrestaShop

1. **Access the PrestaShop Back Office**:
   - Log in to your PrestaShop Back Office.

2. **Navigate to SEO & URLs**:
   - From the left-hand menu, go to **Preferences** > **SEO & URLs**.

3. **Generate the robots.txt File**:
   - Scroll to the bottom of the page to find the **ROBOTS FILE GENERATION** section (see Figure 7-15).
   - Here, you’ll find an option to **Generate** or **Regenerate** the `robots.txt` file.

4. **Click on the "Generate" Button**:
   - Once you click the **Generate** button, PrestaShop will automatically create the **robots.txt** file with basic configurations designed for most PrestaShop stores.

5. **Review and Customize the File**:
   - After generating the file, you should review its contents. PrestaShop’s default settings typically include rules to disallow bots from accessing the admin panel or certain system files.
   - You can also customize the `robots.txt` file to suit your specific needs (e.g., blocking additional directories, setting up specific crawl directives).

6. **Upload the robots.txt File**:
   - If you choose to edit or modify the file manually, upload it to the root directory of your PrestaShop site (where your index.php file is located).

### Default robots.txt Example

Here’s an example of a basic `robots.txt` file generated by PrestaShop:

```plaintext
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /modules/
Disallow: /themes/
Disallow: /img/
Disallow: /pdf/
Disallow: /upload/
Disallow: /translations/
Disallow: /config/
Disallow: /log/
Disallow: /cache/
Disallow: /install/
Disallow: /index.php
Allow: /modules/ps_*
```

How It Works

    User-agent: This field defines which web crawlers (or bots) the rules apply to. In the example above, the * wildcard means the rules apply to all bots.

    Disallow: These lines tell search engine bots which directories or files to avoid crawling. For example, /admin/ prevents crawlers from indexing the admin panel, which is private and unnecessary for search engine rankings.

    Allow: This can be used to specifically allow crawlers to access certain subdirectories or files. For example, the line Allow: /modules/ps_* ensures that bots can access specific PrestaShop modules, even if they are within a directory that's generally disallowed.

When to Customize Your robots.txt File

You might need to customize your robots.txt file for the following reasons:

    Prevent indexing of duplicate content: If your site generates duplicate pages (e.g., filter parameters or session IDs), you should block crawlers from indexing these duplicates.
    Protect sensitive data: If you have directories with private or sensitive information (e.g., payment information, user data), block crawlers from accessing these directories.
    Control crawl budget: By blocking unnecessary files or directories, you can help search engines focus on the most important pages, which can improve your site's SEO.

Example Customizations

    Block specific directory: To block a directory, such as /private_data/, add:

Disallow: /private_data/

Block specific page: To block a single page, such as checkout.php, add:

Disallow: /checkout.php

Allow specific subdirectory: To allow access to a specific module even within a disallowed directory, use:

    Allow: /modules/ps_paymentmodule/
