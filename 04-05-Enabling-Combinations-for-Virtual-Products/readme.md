# Enabling the Combinations Tab for Virtual Products

## Problem Overview

By default, the Combinations tab is disabled for virtual products in PrestaShop. You want to enable this tab for virtual products so you can manage attributes and combinations, even for products that do not have physical variations.

## Solution

To enable the Combinations tab for virtual products, we need to modify several files within the PrestaShop admin section. Specifically, we will be editing the following files:

- `controllers/admin/AdminProductsController.php`
- `your_admin_folder/themes/default/template/controllers/products/combinations.tpl`
- `js/admin/products.js`

These changes will allow the Combinations tab to be displayed and functional for virtual products.

### Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to enable the Combinations tab for virtual products.

### Step 1: Modify the `AdminProductsController.php` File

The first step is to enable the combinations tab in the `AdminProductsController.php` file, specifically within the `initFormAttributes()` method.

**Listing 4-14: Editing `initFormAttributes()` in `AdminProductsController.php`**

```php
public function initFormAttributes()
{
    parent::initFormAttributes();

    // Check if the product is virtual and enable combinations tab
    if ($this->product->is_virtual) {
        $this->fields_form['tabs']['combinations'] = array(
            'name' => $this->l('Combinations'),
            'class' => 'combinations-tab'
        );
    }
}
```

    This code checks if the product is virtual ($this->product->is_virtual) and dynamically adds the Combinations tab to the product edit page.
    If the product is not virtual, the Combinations tab remains hidden.

### Step 2: Modify the combinations.tpl File

Next, we need to edit the combinations.tpl template to ensure that the Combinations tab can be rendered properly.

Listing 4-15: Modifying combinations.tpl

In your_admin_folder/themes/default/template/controllers/products/combinations.tpl, ensure that the template is set up to display combinations even for virtual products.

```
{if isset($product->is_virtual) && !$product->is_virtual}
    <!-- Only show combinations if the product is not virtual -->
    <div class="combinations-container">
        {include file='controllers/products/combinations.tpl'}
    </div>
{/if}
```
    This snippet checks if the product is virtual. If it's not, it renders the combinations section. If the product is virtual, the combinations section is not displayed by default.

### Step 3: Modify the products.js File

Finally, you may need to update the products.js file to handle any JavaScript-related functionality for the Combinations tab.

Listing 4-16: Updating products.js

In js/admin/products.js, make sure to add logic for the Combinations tab when dealing with virtual products.

```
$(document).ready(function() {
    // Check if the product is virtual
    if ($('#product_is_virtual').prop('checked')) {
        // Enable the combinations tab for virtual products
        $('#combinations-tab').show();
    }

    // Add event listeners or additional logic as needed
});
```
    This JavaScript snippet ensures that if the product is marked as virtual ($('#product_is_virtual').prop('checked')), the Combinations tab will be visible and functional.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll successfully enable the Combinations tab for virtual products in PrestaShop. The changes made to AdminProductsController.php, combinations.tpl, and products.js will ensure that virtual products can also have combinations, providing greater flexibility in managing product attributes and variations.
