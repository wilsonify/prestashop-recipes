# Setting Up a Local Server for PrestaShop

## Problem
You need a local server on your PC to develop, test, customize, or explore PrestaShop without paying for a hosting service. Setting up a local environment can be challenging for users unfamiliar with server configurations, database management, and web development tools. The process requires selecting the right technologies to ensure compatibility with PrestaShop while maintaining performance and ease of use.

## Solution
To determine the best local server setup, we must first understand PrestaShopâ€™s requirements. PrestaShop is built using PHP and follows a three-layer architecture resembling the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. Unlike many other platforms, it does not rely on a PHP framework, prioritizing performance and code clarity.

### Key Features of PrestaShop:
- Easy installation process
- User-friendly interface
- Supports features like automated email follow-ups, SEO optimization, and extensive customization
- Highly configurable settings

PrestaShop requires a web server capable of handling dynamic PHP pages. The most widely used option is **Apache**, known for its modular architecture, which allows activation or deactivation of functionalities as needed. For instance, the **mod_rewrite** module is often used to convert dynamic PHP pages into static HTML, improving SEO and security.

PrestaShop also relies on a **MySQL database**, a powerful and widely used relational database management system (DBMS). MySQL is trusted by companies like Amazon, NASA, and Google due to its balance between simplicity and performance, making it ideal for web applications.

## Local Server Solutions
Several pre-configured server environments combine Apache, MySQL, and PHP into a single package, simplifying the setup process:

1. **XAMPP** (Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux) - Includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl
2. **LAMP** (Linux-based: Apache, MySQL, PHP)
3. **MAMP** (Mac-based: Apache, MySQL, PHP)
4. **WAMP** (Windows-based: Apache, MySQL, PHP)

For Windows users, **WAMP** is a great choice. It includes:
- **Apache** as the web server
- **MySQL** as the database engine
- **PHP** for server-side scripting
- **phpMyAdmin** for easy database management

## How It Works
The WAMP environment functions as a medium-sized server with the essential modules needed to run web applications efficiently. 

While not as powerful as full-scale production servers, 
it provides everything necessary for local development, testing, and customization of PrestaShop.

### Steps to Set Up WAMP:
1. Download WAMP from [wampserver.com](http://www.wampserver.com/).
2. Install and configure it on your Windows PC.
3. Place PrestaShop files in the `www` directory.
4. Start WAMP and access PrestaShop via `localhost` in your browser.
5. Use phpMyAdmin to create a database and complete the installation process.
